# SHIP-DETECTION-FROM-SATELLITE-IMAGERY
Ship Detection from Satellite Imagery    Project Overview   This project implements an object-detection model to detect ships in satellite/aerial imagery. The main goal is to train and evaluate a deep learning model to accurately locate ships within high-resolution images of the sea/port regions.
