# SHIP-DETECTION-FROM-SATELLITE-IMAGERY
Ship Detection from Satellite Imagery    Project Overview   This project implements an object-detection model to detect ships in satellite/aerial imagery. The main goal is to train and evaluate a deep learning model to accurately locate ships within high-resolution images of the sea/port regions.    
Dataset  
Source: The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle (e.g., Ships in Satellite Imagery) or similar. :contentReference [oaicite:3] {index=3}  
Because of GitHub size/storage constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.  
You must download the dataset directly from the source link (see above) and place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., `data/`) before running the notebook.  
Format: image files (e.g., `.jpg` or `.png`), annotation files (e.g., bounding boxes in Pascal VOC or COCO format).  
Notes: The dataset includes images both with and without ships, which makes the classification/detection task more challenging. :contentReference [oaicite:4] {index=4}

Notebook / Code  
ship_detection.ipynb (or whichever file) contains the full pipeline:  
  1. Data loading and preprocessing  
  2. Annotation parsing and preparation for model  
  3. Model selection and training (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, etc)  
  4. Evaluation (accuracy, precision/recall/mAP)  
  5. Inference on test images and sample visualisations  
- You should ensure your notebook is well-commented, with code and markdown cells explaining each step.
